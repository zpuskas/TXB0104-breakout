# TXB0104 Breadboard Breakout

Breakout board for the TXB0104 bidirectional voltage-level translator IC with
automatic direction sensing. The main difference of this board compared to
[SparkFun's Voltage-Level Translator Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11771)
is that the OE pin is independent, and not soldered to VCCA by default,
allowing for any side of the communication to be in control of the data flow
out of the box.
